# Uncloaking-RAID0-HWID-Serials
This is a demonstration of how anti-cheats are evolving to gather the original disk serials hidden behind RAID0.

Test system:
- Intel core processor
- 2 x SATA drives

Requirements:
1. Your computer must be set up for RAID.
2. Run as Administrator.


I'm going to continue working on uncloaking NVMe as well as it seemed like there were spiked interest in that field.
I'll keep this thread updated when i have a release on NVMe or more information on the subject.
