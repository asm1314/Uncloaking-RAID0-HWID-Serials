# Uncloaking-RAID0-HWID-Serials
RAID0 has been the go-to method for years to avoid hardware ID (HWID) checks in anti-cheat systems.
This is a demonstration of how easily real disk serials hidden behind NVMe and SATA RAID can be fetched, and may not be as secure as people may think.

Test system:
- Intel core processor
- 2 x SATA drives
- 2 x NVMe drives
- Windows 10 & 11 22H2 (all should be supported)

Requirements:
1. Your computer must be set up for NVMe or SATA RAID (or both).
2. Run as Administrator.
